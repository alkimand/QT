            The CERT_CONTEXT structure contains both the encoded and decoded representations of a certificate. A certificate context returned by one of the
            functions defined in Wincrypt.h must be freed by calling the CertFreeCertificateContext function. The CertDuplicateCertificateContext function can be
            called to make a duplicate copy (which also must be freed by calling CertFreeCertificateContext).
